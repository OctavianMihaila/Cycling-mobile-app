## Project Architecture

- **Flutter Architecture:** Embracing the classic Flutter architecture, Cycling Peloton meticulously designs screens and widgets to deliver an intuitive user experience. This architectural approach, coupled with Provider State Management, guarantees responsiveness, maintainability, and adaptability as we continually improve the cycling experience.

- **Firebase:** Real-time data management is at the core of our app's functionality. With Firebase, we effortlessly handle all aspects of cycling data. This includes storing and retrieving routes, tracking progress, and ensuring seamless data operations within Cycling Peloton.

- **Google Maps API:** Precise location tracking, turn-by-turn directions, and interactive route planning are essential for any cycling app. That's why we leverage the Google Maps API. It provides reliable mapping capabilities, ensuring cyclists always know where they're going.

- **OpenWeatherMap API:** Weather conditions can make or break a cycling experience. We integrate real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap to keep users informed.
